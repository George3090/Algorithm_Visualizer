Algorithm Visualizer - A web application that allow to
visualize the implementation of sorting algorithms.

>Implemented sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort,
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)

>Created a webpage that visualizes how the algorithms are
sorting the array, by using colours to represent each step,
displayed the time/space complexity for each algorithm
